# Black Pill C Code using libopencm3

libopencm3 based Makefile for c programming on the stm32 black pill,.
STM32F411CEU6

Makefile came from the very good book "Begining STM32 Programming"
and was slightly tweaked for the black pill.
The source for that book, where the makefile and dir layout
was taken is here:
